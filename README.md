1. Inline and Internal Styles 10:34
  -There are different ways we can add CSS to a page. First, let’s go over the inline and internal style methods.

2. External Style Sheets
  -With an external style sheet we can change the look of an entire website with one file.

3. Importing Style Sheets with @import
  -The @import statement lets us import CSS from other style sheets. It shares some of the same advantages as linking a stylesheet, like browser caching and maintenance efficiency.

4. Intro to Selectors
  -Selectors are one of the most important and powerful parts of CSS because they let us target the content we want to style. When we define a selector in our stylesheet, we’re instructing the browser to match every instance of that selector in the HTML.

5. Type Selectors
  -Type selectors target element types on the page. They’re also called element selectors because we use the element’s HTML tag as the selector.

6. ID Selectors
  -Unlike a type selector, which targets every element with the corresponding element type, an ID selector lets us assign a unique ID to an element.

7. Class Selectors
  -Class selectors let us target elements based on their class attribute. The main difference between a class and an ID selector is that IDs are unique and they’re used to identify one element on the page, whereas a class can target more than one element.

8. Reusing Classes
  -Besides being able to target more than one element with a single class selector, an element can also have multiple classes assigned to it.

9. Descendant Selectors
  -CSS lets us target elements based on their relationship in the HTML document. We can combine selectors to create descendant selectors that target elements that are descendants of an element. This makes our selectors more specific.

10. Pseudo-Classes
  -Pseudo-classes are similar to classes, but they’re not explicitly defined in an element's class attribute. Unlike type, ID and class selectors, pseudo-classes can target elements dynamically based on user interaction, an element’s state, and more.

11. Pixel Units    
  -When we use pixel units, the size we define will always remain the same and will not scale, regardless of the browser window and size of the screen.

12. Percentages
  -We can define number values more fluidly with percentage units. Percentages, by nature, are always relative to something else. When we use a percentage unit in CSS, the percentage value is measured relative to a parent element's length.
