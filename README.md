1. Inline and Internal Styles 10:34
  -There are different ways we can add CSS to a page. First, let’s go over the inline and internal style methods.

2. External Style Sheets
  -With an external style sheet we can change the look of an entire website with one file.

3. Importing Style Sheets with @import
  -The @import statement lets us import CSS from other style sheets. It shares some of the same advantages as linking a stylesheet, like browser caching and maintenance efficiency.

4. Intro to Selectors
  -Selectors are one of the most important and powerful parts of CSS because they let us target the content we want to style. When we define a selector in our stylesheet, we’re instructing the browser to match every instance of that selector in the HTML.

5. Type Selectors
  -Type selectors target element types on the page. They’re also called element selectors because we use the element’s HTML tag as the selector.
