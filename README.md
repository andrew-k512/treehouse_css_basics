1. Inline and Internal Styles 10:34
  -There are different ways we can add CSS to a page. First, let’s go over the inline and internal style methods.

2. External Style Sheets
  -With an external style sheet we can change the look of an entire website with one file.

3. Importing Style Sheets with @import
  -The @import statement lets us import CSS from other style sheets. It shares some of the same advantages as linking a stylesheet, like browser caching and maintenance efficiency.

4. Intro to Selectors
  -Selectors are one of the most important and powerful parts of CSS because they let us target the content we want to style. When we define a selector in our stylesheet, we’re instructing the browser to match every instance of that selector in the HTML.

5. Type Selectors
  -Type selectors target element types on the page. They’re also called element selectors because we use the element’s HTML tag as the selector.

6. ID Selectors
  -Unlike a type selector, which targets every element with the corresponding element type, an ID selector lets us assign a unique ID to an element.

7. Class Selectors
  -Class selectors let us target elements based on their class attribute. The main difference between a class and an ID selector is that IDs are unique and they’re used to identify one element on the page, whereas a class can target more than one element.

8. Reusing Classes
  -Besides being able to target more than one element with a single class selector, an element can also have multiple classes assigned to it.

9. Descendant Selectors
  -CSS lets us target elements based on their relationship in the HTML document. We can combine selectors to create descendant selectors that target elements that are descendants of an element. This makes our selectors more specific.

10. Pseudo-Classes
  -Pseudo-classes are similar to classes, but they’re not explicitly defined in an element's class attribute. Unlike type, ID and class selectors, pseudo-classes can target elements dynamically based on user interaction, an element’s state, and more.

11. Pixel Units    
  -When we use pixel units, the size we define will always remain the same and will not scale, regardless of the browser window and size of the screen.

12. Percentages
  -We can define number values more fluidly with percentage units. Percentages, by nature, are always relative to something else. When we use a percentage unit in CSS, the percentage value is measured relative to a parent element's length.

13. Em Units
  -Relative length units are relative to other length values. The most commonly used relative unit is the em unit. The em is known as a font-relative unit because it's calculated based on a parent element's font size.

14. Rem Units / Root em
  -The rem unit is similar to the em unit. The difference is that rem is relative only to the root element of the page. This gets us around the compounding font size issue we experience with em units. Not effected by inheritance like Ems are.

15. Color values
  -Color plays an important role in web design. With CSS, we can describe a color value in different ways. The three most common ways are with a keyword, a hexadecimal value, or an RGB function.

16. Text Styles
  -Text has a significant effect on how we view a web page. In this video, we'll cover common properties for defining text styles.

17. Font Properties
  -Like text properties, font properties let us change the appearance of text by assigning a font family, font size, font style, and more.

18. Line Height
  -With the line-height property, we can increase, or decrease, the vertical gaps between lines of text.

19. Padding
  -Padding is often used to give an element's content area some breathing room by separating the content from the surrounding border area.

20. Borders
  -In this video, we'll cover three properties we can use to create and style borders.

21. Margins
  -Margins affect the area outside a box. We commonly use margin properties to create space around elements.

22. Display values
  -With the display property, we can override the default display settings of an element. In this video, we'll cover the three most common types of display values.

21. Width & Height properties
  -By default, an element's width and height are as wide or as tall as the content it holds. But we're able to set our own dimensions with the width and height properties.

22. Box-sizing and max-width
  -With the box-sizing property, we can alter the way the browser calculates an element's total width and height. We're also able to set the maximum width of an element with the max-width property.

23. Backgrounds: Color and Images
  -Every HTML element has a background layer that is transparent by default. In this video, you'll learn basic background properties for applying colors and images.

24. Backgrounds: Size and Position
  -In this video, we'll learn how certain properties affect the size and position of an element's background.

25. Floats
  -In this video, we’ll learn some of the basics of float layout.

26. Clearing Floats
  -If a block element contains floated children, its height will collapse. In this video, we'll learn two methods for accommodating floated elements.

27. Lists
  -In this video, we’ll cover the different ways we can use list properties to control the appearance of our lists.

28. Text Shadows
  -In this video, we'll learn how to add shadows to text with CSS.

29. Box Shadows
  -Like text-shadow, we're able to cast shadows off elements with the box-shadow property.

30. Border Radius
  -CSS has properties that let us create rounded corners on elements without the need for any images or extra markup. With border-radius, we can define exactly how rounded the borders appear.

31. Gradients
  -With CSS gradients, we can add depth to our designs by creating smooth and gradual transitions between two or more colors.

32. Web Fonts with @font-face
  -Web fonts are special types of fonts that are optimized for screen display, and they're linked to our web pages from an external source. Web fonts eliminate the need to depend on the limited number of fonts installed on a user's computers.
